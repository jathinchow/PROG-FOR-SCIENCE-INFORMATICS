gunzip: For unzipping `.gz` files.
head: For extracting the first 10 lines of a file.
wc: For counting the number of lines in a file.
touch: command used for creating empty files

Usage Instructions :
Ensure Prerequisites: Make sure you have Bash, `wget`, `gunzip`, `head`, and `wc` installed on your system.
