Description 
This program performs various analyses on a DNA sequence from the file `chr1_GL383518v1_alt.txt`. It includes reading the sequence, generating the reverse complement, and analyzing nucleotide frequencies.

Requirements
- Python 3.10 64 bits
- Ensure the sequence file `chr1_GL383518v1_alt.txt` is in the same directory as this script.

Functionality
1. Read Sequence: The program reads the DNA sequence from a file and prints specific letters.
2. Reverse Complement: It computes the reverse complement and retrieves specified letters.
3. Nucleotide Counts: The program creates a nested dictionary to track the number of nucleotides per kilobase.
4. Summation Check: It calculates the sum of nucleotides in each kilobase and checks against the expected value.

Conclusion
This script enables a basic analysis of DNA sequences by counting nucleotides and generating reverse complements. Extending this work can lead to deeper insights in genomic studies.
